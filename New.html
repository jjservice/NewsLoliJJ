        <p class="writername">(By Bailey Richards)</p>

            <p class="p2desc">The 37-year-old rapper’s son Adonis Graham turned 7 on Friday, Oct. 11, 
            and he celebrated by throwing what appears to be a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed bash — and sharing father-son snaps.
            
            <br><br>On Sunday, Oct. 13, the “One Dance” rapper (born Aubrey Drake Graham) marked the 7-year-old’s latest milestone with a sweet Instagram post.
            
            
            Drake shared two photos, featuring himself and Adonis, backdropped by a Bikini Bottom-inspired setting, 
            including jellyfish and the cartoon’s flower-shaped clouds.
            SpongeBob-inspired text read, “Adonis’ 7th Birthday.”

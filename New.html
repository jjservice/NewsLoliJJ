                <p class="p2desc">Celebrated every 10 November, World Science Day for Peace and Development highlights the significant role of science in society and the need to engage the wider public in debates on emerging scientific issues.
                     It also underlines the importance and relevance of science in our daily lives.

                  <br><br>By linking science more closely with society, World Science Day for Peace and Development aims to ensure that citizens are kept informed of developments in science. 
                   It also underscores the role scientists play in broadening our understanding of the remarkable, fragile planet we call home and in making our societies more sustainable.
                   <br><br>
                    
                    The Day offers the opportunity to mobilize all actors around the topic of science for peace and development – from government officials to the media to school pupils. UNESCO strongly encourages all to join in celebrating World Science Day for Peace and Development by organizing your own event or activity on the day.

            <p class="p2desc">The 37-year-old rapper’s son Adonis Graham turned 7 on Friday, Oct. 11,
            and he celebrated by throwing what appears to be a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed bash — and sharing father-son snaps.
            
            <br><br>On Sunday, Oct. 13, the “One Dance” rapper (born Aubrey Drake Graham) marked the 7-year-old’s latest milestone with a sweet Instagram post.
            
            Drake shared two photos, featuring himself and Adonis, backdropped by a Bikini Bottom-inspired setting, 
            including jellyfish and the cartoon’s flower-shaped clouds.
            SpongeBob-inspired text read, “Adonis’ 7th Birthday.”

                            On Oct. 12, Big Draco posted a clip to social media of himself in the cockpit of a plane with a pilot gearing up for takeoff. “I was the first rapper to fly an airplane. Let’s go, we bout to get in the air,” he said in the video. “You ready to do this? Let’s do this.”<br><br>

                <p class="p2desc">The 2024-25 Golden State Warriors are certainly a ‘good’ team. But despite their strong footing within the Western Conference standing, currently the fifth seed, I think we’ve seen enough to confidently say the 2024-25 Warriors are not a ‘great’ team. Without some sort of major shakeup or change, 
                    the Warriors cannot with a straight face look themselves in the mirror and call themselves contenders.

                    Recent history has proved that there are plenty of ways for content creators-turned-boxers to draw interest from future opponents. 
                    Some have used the path of deflection, downplaying their desire to face someone to get under that fighter's skin. 
                    Some have directly called out the fighter they wanted to face.

                    However, this weekend proved that one option will have all the sport's top stars clamoring to be the next fighter opposite of you in the boxing ring:
                    beat a 58-year-old legend and former undisputed heavyweight champion.

                <p class="p2desc">DETROIT NOV.13.2024 -- Erik Spoelstra blamed himself for a "horrendous mistake" after calling a timeout the Miami Heat didn't have with 1.1 seconds left in overtime Tuesday night, a technical foul that gave the Detroit Pistons the tiebreaking free throw.
                     
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Malik Beasley made it and the Pistons went on to beat the Heat 123-121 on the opening night of NBA Cup play.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    "I made just a serious mental error there at the end," Spoelstra said. "That's on me. I feel horrible about it."
                      <br>
                      <br>
                    The Heat had a 121-119 lead after Tyler Herro's basket with 1.8 seconds remaining. But after a timeout, the Pistons ran a well-executed inbounds play, with Cade Cunningham throwing a lob pass that Jalen Duren slammed down.

                    Recent history has proved that there are plenty of ways for content creators-turned-boxers to draw interest from future opponents. 
                    Some have used the path of deflection, downplaying their desire to face someone to get under that fighter's skin. 
                    Some have directly called out the fighter they wanted to face.

                    <br> 
                    However, this weekend proved that one option will have all the sport's top stars clamoring to be the next fighter opposite of you in the boxing ring:
                    beat a 58-year-old legend and former undisputed heavyweight champion.

                    <br>
            
                    All three judges scored the fight for Paul, 80-72, 79-73 and 79-73.

                <p class="p2desc">DETROIT NOV.13.2024 -- Erik Spoelstra blamed himself for a "horrendous mistake" after calling a timeout the Miami Heat didn't have with 1.1 seconds left in overtime Tuesday night, a technical foul that gave the Detroit Pistons the tiebreaking free throw.
                     
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Malik Beasley made it and the Pistons went on to beat the Heat 123-121 on the opening night of NBA Cup play.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    "I made just a serious mental error there at the end," Spoelstra said. "That's on me. I feel horrible about it."
                      <br>
                      <br>
                    The Heat had a 121-119 lead after Tyler Herro's basket with 1.8 seconds remaining. But after a timeout, the Pistons ran a well-executed inbounds play, with Cade Cunningham throwing a lob pass that Jalen Duren slammed down.

                <p class="p2desc">In this week’s #BusinessTipTuesday, November 12th marks the unofficial holiday National Happy Hour Day. While this may seem like a silly thing to talk about when discussing how you run a business, this day can actually serve as a great reminder that running a successful business should include time to relax with employees and appreciate the hard work you have put in over a certain period of time. 
                    <br>
                    <br>While cultivating your business requires focus, determination, hard work, and many other key attributes, sometimes what you need to maintain a consistent approach is an opportunity to spend time with employees outside of work and really recharge to stay motivated. This also allows your employees an opportunity to connect on more than just work and encourage the building of interpersonal relationships among team members.

                <p class="p2desc">Celebrated every 10 November, World Science Day for Peace and Development highlights the significant role of science in society and the need to engage the wider public in debates on emerging scientific issues.
                     It also underlines the importance and relevance of science in our daily lives.

                  <br><br>By linking science more closely with society, World Science Day for Peace and Development aims to ensure that citizens are kept informed of developments in science. 
                   It also underscores the role scientists play in broadening our understanding of the remarkable, fragile planet we call home and in making our societies more sustainable.
                   <br><br>
                    
                    The Day offers the opportunity to mobilize all actors around the topic of science for peace and development – from government officials to the media to school pupils. UNESCO strongly encourages all to join in celebrating World Science Day for Peace and Development by organizing your own event or activity on the day.
